# 3. MongoDB URI should include authentication credentials
# 4. Auth0 domain should NOT include https://
# 5. Google Client ID is for OAuth integration
# 6. allowed_origins restricts CORS to specific domains for security
# 7. If using existing secrets, ensure they contain the required JSON structure
