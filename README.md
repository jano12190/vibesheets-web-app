# VibeSheets

VibeSheets is a modern timesheet management application built with a React + TypeScript frontend and AWS serverless backend. The application features Auth0 authentication, real-time clock in/out functionality, and comprehensive time tracking with CSV export capabilities.

The architecture uses AWS Lambda functions for the backend API, DynamoDB for data storage, and CloudFront for global content delivery. Infrastructure is managed through Terraform, with automated CI/CD pipelines ensuring reliable deployments to the vibesheets.com domain.
